# Small Frontend Pokemon App

Simple app built for code test. The app was built in React and styled with Tailwind for quickness.
Requirements are as below:

## Task 1
We'd like to have a small frontend which lists all Pokémons which exists. Therefore, we have an [Pokémon Api](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#info) or a node_module [pokenode-ts](https://github.com/Gabb-c/pokenode-ts).

In the list we'd like to see the name and the image (can be found inside sprites) of the Pokémon. You can use whatever you want (Table, Cards, or other components)

## Task 2
When clicking on one Pokémon we'd like to see some more information of this Pokémon (doesn't really matter which information, just some)

## To run app
* Install packages with `npm install`
* Start app with `npm run dev`

## Demo is available on: https://pokemon-app-calum.herokuapp.com/

## Further work
It was advised to only spend a few hours on this, so here are a few improvements I would make with more time:
* Testing, unit and integration tests using Jest
* Pagination to handle all pokemon data
* Styling and cleaner loading when navigating to Details pages
